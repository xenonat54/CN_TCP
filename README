##Java TCP Chat Application

This is a simple client-server chat application built using Java TCP sockets and Swing GUI.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Swing for GUI
- java.net.Socket and ServerSocket for TCP networking

## 📁 Files
- `Server.java` – Server-side application
- `Client.java` – Client-side application
- `README.md` – This file

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile both Java files:
   ```bash
   javac Server.java
   javac Client.java
   ```

2. Run the Server first:
   ```bash
   java Server
   ```

3. Run the Client in a new terminal or IDE instance:
   ```bash
   java Client
   ```

Now you can send and receive messages through the GUI interfaces.

## 📌 Notes
- Ensure the port (5000) is available on your machine.
- The current version supports only one client.
- Can be extended to a multi-client chat using threads or socket pools.
